1) need function to pass local file and upload through Pinanta
2) need to get the URI info
3) take URI info and create a single json file with the same name as image (most likely they will be numbered)
4) need a single function that then uploads the metadata json file up to IPFS through Pinata
5) Need single function where I can call update function in sol file that takes TOkendID and new URI data
that about right??
